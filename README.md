## Welcome to my GitHub Repository!


#### "I know what you're thinking, 'cause right now I'm thinking the same thing. Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here: Why oh why didn't I take the [BLUE](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ref_=ttqt_qt_tt) pill?" -The Matrix (1999)


# About me ![icons8-neo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74195719/117961754-78952b80-b2ec-11eb-89fa-ede9e752d529.png)
Screenwriter turned <i>Spaghetti</i> Coder exploring the wide world of web development. I'm feeling a lot like how I would imagine `Neo` might have felt right after he shoved that `RED` pill down his throat. 

I've barely even begun to scratch the surface of all there is to know about web development, but I intended to bring the same amount of passion and creativity to my coding as I do screenwriting. Please continue to check back periodically as I continue to improve my skills and expand my respository.
